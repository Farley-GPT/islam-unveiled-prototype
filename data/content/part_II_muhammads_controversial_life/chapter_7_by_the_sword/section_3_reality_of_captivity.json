            "text": "Islamic tradition, and its modern apologists, often highlight Muhammad's supposed kindness towards prisoners of war. They point to anecdotes like after the Battle of Badr, where Muslims allegedly gave their captives bread while eating only dates themselves, or the general principle of providing food and clothing. These stories paint a picture of elevated ethical standards, a stark contrast to the brutality common in 7th-century Arabia. But like so much else in the traditional narrative, this is a carefully curated, highly selective image that conveniently ignores the harsher, more brutal realities of how captives, especially women and those deemed important enemies, were actually treated under Muhammad's command."

            "text": "Yes, some male prisoners were ransomed after Badr, sometimes by teaching Muslim children to read if they couldn't afford money. Others were exchanged or even released unconditionally, particularly later after victories like the conquest of Mecca. But these acts of calculated leniency shouldn't obscure the grimmer options that were frequently employed when mercy wasn't politically expedient."

            "text": "Execution was certainly on the table. Immediately after Badr, two key Meccan prisoners, an-Nadr ibn al-Harith and 'Uqbah ibn Abi Mu'ayt, were singled out and executed. The justification wasn't their status as prisoners, but their past \"crimes\" against Muhammad and Muslims in Mecca. This set a precedent: being a captive offered no absolute immunity if Muhammad considered you a particularly troublesome enemy deserving punishment."

            "text": "The most horrific example, of course, is the fate of the Banu Qurayza tribe. After surrendering following the Battle of the Trench, the decision on their fate was handed to their former ally, Sa'd ibn Mu'adh. His verdict, approved by Muhammad, wasn't ransom or exile; it was death for all adult males. Between 600 and 800 men were systematically beheaded in trenches dug in Medina's marketplace. This wasn't a targeted execution of \"war criminals\"; it was a wholesale massacre of surrendered combatants (and likely many non-combatants deemed \"adult\")."

            "text": "And what of the women and children from conquered or defeated groups? Their fate was often enslavement. The women and children of the Banu Qurayza were explicitly enslaved and distributed, along with the tribe's property, among the Muslim fighters as spoils of war. This wasn't an isolated incident. Following the conquest of the Jewish oasis of Khaybar, women, including the chief's wife Safiyya bint Huyayy (whose husband and father had just been killed), were taken captive. Muhammad famously took Safiyya for himself, marrying her after a brief waiting period."

            "text": "The status of female captives often included sexual availability to their captors, euphemistically referred to in the Quran as \"those whom your right hands possess.\" Hadith sources (like one in Sunan Abu Dawud regarding captives from the Battle of Awtas) indicate Muslim men having intercourse with captive women whose husbands were still alive among the enemy â€“ a practice that caused some initial \"reluctance\" but was clearly permitted. While modern apologists insist Islam doesn't permit enslavement or capture of enemy women simply because they belong to the enemy ranks, the historical accounts from the foundational period clearly show this happened repeatedly, sanctioned by the highest authority."

            "type": "paragraph",
            "text": "The narrative of universal mercy towards captives is a myth. Muhammad employed a range of options, from ransom and release to execution and enslavement, based on strategic calculation and the perceived threat or status of the captives. The brutal elimination of the Banu Qurayza men and the routine enslavement and sexual availability of captured women reveal a far darker reality than the sanitized picture usually presented. Mercy was conditional; subjugation and elimination were readily available tools."
