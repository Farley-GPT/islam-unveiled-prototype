            "text": "Looking back at Muhammad's personal conduct – his exceptional marital privileges justified by timely revelations, the ethically disturbing marriage to a child, the scandal surrounding Zaynab, and the political chaos immediately following his death – a consistent picture emerges. This wasn't the legacy of a meticulous divine planner establishing an eternal, flawless blueprint for humanity. It was the legacy of a powerful, charismatic individual who built a movement centered intensely around his own person, his claimed unique connection to the divine, and his strategic needs of the moment."

            "text": "The repeated \"revelations\" catering specifically to his personal desires and exemptions (\"exclusively for you\") suggest not divine necessity, but the convenient perks of being the sole conduit for God's supposed word. A truly universal message wouldn't require such personalized loopholes for its messenger. The actions regarding Aisha and Zaynab, regardless of apologetic defenses, raise fundamental questions about his moral compass when judged against enduring ethical principles, rather than the shifting sands of claimed historical context. Can actions considered abhorrent today truly have been divinely sanctioned then? The critical mind balks."

            "text": "The succession crisis further underscores this point. If Islam was a perfect, complete system ordained by an omniscient God, surely that God would have provided a clear, unambiguous mechanism for leadership transition beyond the Prophet's death? The fact that Muhammad seemingly left this crucial issue unresolved (according to Sunnis) or that his supposed designation of Ali (according to Shia) was immediately overridden by political maneuvering at Saqifa, points to a system overly reliant on the founder's personal authority. It suggests a personality cult, where loyalty and structure revolved entirely around Muhammad, rather than a robust, divinely ordained institution designed to endure seamlessly beyond his lifetime. The immediate infighting and the eventual, bloody Sunni-Shia split are not tragic aberrations; they are arguably the logical consequence of a succession left ambiguous or contested at the very source."

            "text": "In essence, Muhammad's personal life wasn't merely incidental to his prophecy; it was often intertwined with it, shaping its specific \"revelations\" and demonstrating its practical limits. His death didn't usher in a pre-ordained golden age of righteous leadership; it triggered a power struggle rooted in the tribal and political realities he had navigated, but never fully transcended. The legacy wasn't one of a perfect plan flawlessly executed, but of a singular, powerful personality whose actions continue to demand uncomfortable questions and whose departure left behind a vacuum filled with conflict and competing claims to his authority. The foundation wasn't divine perfection; it was human complexity, ambition, and undeniable charisma, now solidified into dogma."
