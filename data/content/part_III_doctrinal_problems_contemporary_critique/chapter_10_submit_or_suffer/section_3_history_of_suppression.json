            "text": "The theological preference for submission over critical inquiry wasn't just theoretical; it translated into real-world suppression throughout Islamic history. Whenever intellectual currents emerged that seemed to challenge orthodox interpretations or the authority of the religious establishment (often allied with political power), the response was frequently harsh, involving persecution, censorship, and sometimes violence. The history of Islamic civilization is punctuated by episodes where free thought was deliberately and systematically crushed."

            "text": "The Mihna (inquisition) under the Abbasid Caliph al-Ma'mun in the 9th century provides a stark, early example. Ironically, it was instigated by the rationalist Mu'tazilites who, having gained state power, attempted to forcibly impose their doctrine of the Quran being created (rather than eternal) upon the traditionalist Hadith scholars. Figures like Ahmad ibn Hanbal, who refused to conform, were imprisoned and flogged. This episode demonstrates that intolerance wasn't exclusive to traditionalists; even proponents of \"reason\" could become authoritarian persecutors when fused with state power. Later, when Caliph al-Mutawakkil reversed policy, it was the Mu'tazilites' turn to face suppression, their school eventually marginalized. The Mihna established a dangerous precedent of the state enforcing theological conformity through coercion."

            "text": "The 11th century saw the influential theologian al-Ghazali launch his famous critique of Hellenistic philosophy in \"The Incoherence of the Philosophers.\" While nuanced in its arguments, its impact was profound. It successfully challenged the premises of philosophers like Ibn Sina (Avicenna) and al-Farabi, deeming some of their core ideas (like the eternity of the world and denial of bodily resurrection) incompatible with Islam and bordering on heresy. Though not direct state suppression, al-Ghazali's work provided powerful theological ammunition for orthodox authorities wary of rational philosophy, contributing significantly to its decline within mainstream Sunni intellectual life."

            "text": "The fate of Ibn Rushd (Averroes) in 12th-century Almohad Spain exemplifies the consequences of defending philosophy against rising orthodoxy. Averroes, a staunch Aristotelian who wrote a point-by-point rebuttal to al-Ghazali (\"The Incoherence of the Incoherence\"), argued for the compatibility of reason and revelation. His reward? Accusations of heresy, public condemnation, exile, and the burning of his philosophical works by order of the Caliph. Only his medical and scientific writings were spared – a clear sign that it was his philosophical and theological challenges to orthodoxy that were deemed dangerous."

Inquisitors rooted out suspected heretics, leading to imprisonment, exile (like Ibn al-Rawandi), or execution. Even poets like Abu Nuwas faced accusations for expressing impious sentiments. Later, figures like the Jewish philosopher Ibn Kammuna faced mob violence for critically examining Islam."

Critical inquiry wasn't consistently cherished; it was frequently seen as dangerous, subversive, and deserving of suppression, often brutally enforced."
