            "text": "Muhammad starts preaching his new message in Mecca, his hometown, the center of Quraysh power and pagan pilgrimage. The traditional Islamic story portrays this as a noble prophet bravely bringing light to ignorant barbarians who stubbornly rejected him out of sheer arrogance and love for their idols. But the reality, pieced together even from Islam's own sources, is far less heroic for Muhammad and far more understandable from the Meccans' perspective. His message wasn't just ignored; it was often actively rejected, ridiculed, and questioned by people who actually knew him and were familiar with the religious landscape he was trying to revolutionize."

            "text": "A key source of rejection came from those who possessed existing religious knowledge, particularly Meccans familiar with Jewish and Christian traditions circulating in the region. The Quran itself records their accusations: that Muhammad was simply inventing his revelations, a \"lie\" he forged with the help of others (Quran 25:4). They accused him of just retelling \"tales of the ancients\" (Quran 6:25, 8:31, etc.). This wasn't necessarily a dismissal from ignorance; it was likely a critique from people recognizing garbled or altered versions of stories they already knew from Jewish and Christian sources. They weren't hearing divine revelation; they were hearing familiar narratives being poorly repurposed."

            "text": "Others tried to categorize him within known, human roles. Was he a kahin (a soothsayer, a diviner in the traditional Arab mold)? Was he a sha'ir (a poet, inspired perhaps by jinn, but decidedly human)? The Quran vehemently denies these labels (Quran 69:41-42), but the very fact that these were common accusations shows that his contemporaries were trying to place him within existing, understandable frameworks, implicitly rejecting his claim to a unique, unprecedented pipeline to the one true God."

            "text": "Then there was the demand for miracles. If he was truly a prophet like Moses or Jesus, where were the undeniable signs? The Quran repeatedly shows Muhammad being challenged on this point and essentially deflecting, stating his only miracle is the Quran itself, or that signs are only for God to grant (Quran 6:37, 10:20, 13:7, etc.). To a skeptical audience used to traditions where prophets performed wonders, this likely seemed like a weak excuse, further undermining his claims."

            "text": "Crucially, the powerful elite of Mecca, the leaders of the Quraysh clans who controlled the city's trade and religious life, largely remained unconverted. While tradition blames their pride and vested economic interests (which were certainly factors), their rejection also suggests they simply weren't convinced by Muhammad's message or his claims to authority. They saw him not as a divine messenger, but perhaps as a disruptive element, a political challenger, maybe even someone mentally unstable (\"majnÅ«n\" - possessed or mad, another accusation recorded in the Quran)."

            "text": "The Meccan period wasn't just about Muhammad facing down ignorant idolaters. It was about his message failing to gain significant traction among those who knew him best and those who had the intellectual tools (familiarity with other monotheistic traditions) to critically evaluate his claims. This widespread rejection and ridicule formed the crucible in which his later radicalization would be forged."
