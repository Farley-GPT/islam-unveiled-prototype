            "text": "Apologists for Islam love to repeat the mantra: all early Islamic warfare was purely defensive, a necessary response to Meccan persecution. It's a comforting narrative, painting Muhammad as a reluctant warrior only taking up arms to protect his fledgling community. It's also demonstrably false, a deliberate whitewashing of the aggressive raiding and economic warfare that began almost immediately after the Hijra to Medina. The goal wasn't just survival; it was plunder, power, and payback."

            "text": "Remember, Muhammad and his Muhajirun followers arrived in Medina largely destitute, having left their property behind in Mecca. While the Ansar provided initial support, it wasn't a sustainable long-term solution. What better way to support the community and weaken their Meccan enemies than by attacking the lifeline of Quraysh wealth – their trade caravans traveling between Syria and Yemen?"

The historical sources are quite explicit about the objectives. Expeditions like Waddan (August 623), Buwat (October 623), and Kharar (May/June 623) were specifically launched \"to raid parties of the Quraysh.\" Ibn Ishaq records Muhammad leading 200 men towards Buwat \"making for Quraysh.\" There's no mention of imminent Meccan attack or defense here; this was offensive action aimed at seizing goods – economic warfare."

            "text": "The turning point came with the Nakhla raid in January 624. Muhammad sent a small group under Abdullah ibn Jahsh with sealed instructions, telling them to proceed for two days and only then open them. The instructions reportedly told them to lie in wait for a Quraysh caravan at Nakhla (between Mecca and Ta'if) and \"observe what they were doing.\" What they did was attack the caravan, killing one man (Amr ibn al-Hadrami), capturing two others, and seizing all the goods. This raid was doubly provocative: it resulted in the first bloodshed between Muslims and Meccans, and critically, it occurred during Rajab, one of the four sacred months when fighting was traditionally forbidden even by pagan Arabs."

            "text": "The sources record that this transgression caused significant controversy, even among some Muslims. How was this justified? Conveniently, a Quranic \"revelation\" (2:217) soon appeared, acknowledging that fighting in the sacred month was grave, but arguing that Meccan \"persecution\" (preventing access to the Kaaba, driving Muslims out) was worse, thus implicitly sanctioning the raid after the fact. It's a classic pattern: act aggressively, face criticism, receive a divine justification."

They reveal a clear strategy of offensive raiding aimed at economic gain and weakening the enemy, initiated by Muhammad long before Mecca posed any direct military threat to Medina itself. This wasn't self-defense; it was calculated brigandage paving the way for larger confrontations like Badr, which itself began as an attempt to intercept a massive Quraysh caravan. The \"Religion of Peace\" started its Medinan phase with highway robbery."
