Its presence in these foundational sources, despite being deeply unflattering to Muhammad, lends it significant historical weight, arguably through the \"argument from embarrassment\" – why would early Muslims invent a story that made their prophet look so bad, seemingly compromising his core message under pressure?"

According to these sources, while reciting Surah An-Najm (Chapter 53), which mentions the three chief Meccan goddesses Al-Lat, Al-Uzza, and Manat (verses 19-20), Muhammad supposedly uttered – or had uttered through him by Satanic suggestion – additional verses not found in the Quran today. The alleged verses were:"

It acknowledged the Meccan goddesses, seemingly validating their status and power to intercede with the high god Allah – a direct contradiction of Muhammad's core monotheistic message! The effect, according to the early sources, was immediate and dramatic. The Quraysh leaders, hearing this apparent concession, were delighted. They reportedly joined Muhammad and his followers in prostration at the end of the surah, signaling a reconciliation. News of this détente spread so fast that Muslim emigrants who had fled persecution to Abyssinia started returning home, believing the conflict was over."

            "text": "But the reconciliation was short-lived. The story continues that the Angel Gabriel later came to Muhammad, reprimanded him, and revealed that the compromising verses were not from Allah but were interpolations whispered by Satan. Muhammad, distraught, retracted the verses. The Quran we have today contains verses 53:21-23, which sharply critique the goddesses (\"Are you to have the male and He the female? That would be a most unjust distribution! They are naught but names which ye have named...\"), completely reversing the alleged conciliatory message."

            "text": "For critics of Islam, the Satanic Verses incident is a smoking gun. It suggests a Muhammad desperate for acceptance, willing to compromise his fundamental theological principles for political gain. It shatters the concept of prophetic infallibility (Ismah) and the idea of a perfectly transmitted, divinely protected revelation. Whether Satanic temptation, a calculated political gamble that backfired, or a simple mistake later attributed to Satan, the incident reveals a very human prophet capable of error and compromise under pressure. The frantic retraction and subsequent theological justifications look less like divine correction and more like panicked backtracking after realizing the disastrous implications of his momentary concession to paganism."
