            "text": "When deflection and whitewashing don't work, another favorite tactic of Islamic apologists is to attack the credentials or qualifications of the critic, rather than engaging with the substance of their argument. This is a form of ad hominem attack combined with an appeal to false authority, designed to intimidate critics and dismiss their points without actually refuting them. Essentially, they try to build an insurmountable wall of prerequisites, declaring that only those with specialized, often religiously-approved, qualifications are even allowed to have an opinion."

            "text": "You'll often hear the refrain: \"You can't criticize the Quran or Hadith unless you are fluent in Classical Arabic!\" This sounds reasonable on the surface â€“ nuances can be lost in translation. But it's often used as a disingenuous gatekeeping mechanism. Firstly, numerous reliable translations exist, produced by both Muslim and non-Muslim scholars. Secondly, many criticisms focus on core narrative events, ethical principles, or blatant contradictions that are perfectly clear even in translation. Thirdly, many prominent critics of Islam are native Arabic speakers or scholars of Arabic themselves! The language barrier argument is frequently a smokescreen used to dismiss inconvenient critiques from non-specialists or Westerners."

            "text": "Another variation is the \"credential policing\" noted in the research: \"They argue that critics of Islam lack the 'credentials' to comment on Islamic teachings. They insist that one must have a PhD in philosophy or Islamic studies before they can question or critique Islamic morality.\" This is pure intellectual snobbery designed to exclude ordinary people from the conversation. Do you need a PhD in political science to criticize a politician? Do you need a degree in ethics to recognize cruelty? Of course not. While scholarly expertise is valuable, fundamental ethical and logical arguments about religious texts and historical actions should be accessible to any rational person. Demanding specific academic degrees, particularly from institutions potentially biased towards traditional interpretations, is simply another way to avoid addressing the critique itself."

            "text": "Sometimes this extends to using overly complex or obscure theological or philosophical terminology (as noted in research) to deliberately confuse the audience and make the critic seem uninformed or naive if they can't engage at that level. It's a way of saying, \"This is too complicated for you simple folk, trust us experts (who happen to agree with the orthodox view).\""

            "type": "paragraph",
            "text": "Underlying all this is often an appeal to religious authority disguised as academic authority. The implication is that only a believing, practicing Muslim scholar, trained within the tradition, can truly understand Islam and is therefore qualified to interpret its texts or history. Critiques from non-Muslims or ex-Muslims are dismissed out of hand as inherently biased, ignorant, or malicious, regardless of the evidence presented."

You don't need a PhD in Islamic Studies or fluency in 7th-century Arabic to recognize a contradiction in the Quran, to question the morality of marrying a child based on Hadith accounts, or to be disturbed by Sharia punishments. These are matters of basic logic, ethics, and historical analysis. The attempt to restrict the conversation only to credentialed insiders, especially those vetted by the religious establishment itself, is a transparent effort to control the narrative and shield Islam from the kind of open, critical inquiry it clearly fears."
