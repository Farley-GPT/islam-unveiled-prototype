            "text": "One of the most telling indicators that the \"Age of Ignorance\" narrative is a fabrication is how much of Islam's core rituals and symbols were demonstrably not invented by Muhammad, but rather appropriated from the very pagan practices he supposedly came to eradicate. He didn't build from scratch; he renovated, rebranded, and ultimately hijacked existing structures and beliefs, infusing them with a new, monotheistic meaning that served his agenda."

            "text": "Consider the absolute centerpiece: the Kaaba in Mecca. Islamic tradition claims Abraham and Ishmael built it as the first house of worship to the one God. But historical and archaeological evidence points clearly to its function as a major pagan shrine long before Muhammad. It housed those 360 idols. The Black Stone embedded in its corner? Already venerated by pre-Islamic Arabs. Muhammad didn't destroy the Kaaba; he conquered it, \"cleansed\" it of idols (keeping the structure itself), and simply declared its pagan origins were a corruption of its \"true\" Abrahamic past. Convenient."

            "text": "And the Hajj pilgrimage? Nearly every core ritual has clear pre-Islamic pagan roots. Circumambulating the Kaaba seven times (tawaf)? Pagan Arabs did that, sometimes even naked, claiming they came before God as their mothers bore them. Muhammad kept the circling, just mandated clothes. Standing on Mount Arafat? Staying at Mina and Muzdalifah? Running between the hills of Safa and Marwah? Animal sacrifice? Head-shaving? Even the lesser pilgrimage (Umrah)? All documented components of the complex pre-Islamic Hajj ceremonies, often managed by different tribes. Muhammad didn't invent the Hajj; he streamlined it, standardized it under Quraysh (his tribe's) control, purged the overt polytheism, and bolted on an Abrahamic origin story. It was a masterful appropriation of existing, deeply ingrained ritual behavior."

            "text": "Even the concept of \"Allah\" wasn't Muhammad's invention. Historical evidence shows Allah was known to pre-Islamic Arabs as the chief god in their pantheon, the creator god, the special deity of the Quraysh tribe itself. He wasn't the only god, but he was likely the supreme one. The famous \"Daughters of Allah\" – Al-Lat, Al-Uzza, and Manat – were widely worshipped alongside him. Muhammad's \"revolutionary\" move wasn't introducing Allah, but demanding exclusive worship for him and denying the existence or efficacy of all other deities, including Allah's own supposed daughters. He took the existing top god and declared all competitors null and void."

            "text": "The belief in Jinn? Also widespread in pre-Islamic Arabia. These supernatural beings, inhabiting desolate places and influencing human affairs, were feared and sometimes worshipped. Islam didn't dismiss them as superstition. Instead, it absorbed them into its cosmology, declaring them another race of beings created by Allah, possessing free will, capable of being Muslim or Kafir (unbeliever), and subject to final judgment – neatly neutralizing the need to appease them directly."

            "text": "This pattern is undeniable: take existing structures, rituals, beliefs, and even divine names that are deeply embedded in the culture, strip them of their polytheistic associations, claim they were corrupted remnants of an original monotheism, and present the \"restored,\" Islamized version as divine revelation. It's not innovation; it's a hostile takeover of cultural and religious property."
