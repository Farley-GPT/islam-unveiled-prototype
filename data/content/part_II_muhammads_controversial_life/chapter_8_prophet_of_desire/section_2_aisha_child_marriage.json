Early biographical sources like Ibn Sa'd concur, placing her marriage around age six or seven and consummation at nine, shortly after the migration to Medina."

They try to \"recalculate\" her age, often using flimsy arguments based on her sister Asma's age or speculating about supposed different calendars. They claim the narrators (particularly Hisham ibn Urwa, who transmitted many versions) were unreliable or misunderstood, despite Hisham being a respected traditional scholar and these narrations being accepted for centuries. They grasp at straws, pointing to Al-Tabari's contradictory mention of Aisha being born in Jahiliyyah elsewhere in his vast works, ignoring his specific confirmation of the young age in the marriage context. Some even argue that girls in 7th-century Arabia simply \"matured earlier.\""

            "text": "These excuses are pathetic and morally bankrupt. Firstly, the textual evidence from the most venerated Islamic sources is overwhelming and consistent on the 6/9 age. To deny it requires rejecting the very foundation of Hadith methodology that Sunnism is built upon. Secondly, the \"historical context\" argument is a dangerous exercise in moral relativism. Child marriage and the sexual consummation of marriage with a prepubescent girl constitute child abuse by any universal ethical standard, regardless of time period or cultural norms. Attempting to normalize or excuse it based on 7th-century practices is grotesque. Whether Aisha was \"mature\" at nine (a dubious claim itself) is irrelevant; she was a child."

            "text": "Furthermore, the attempt to paint this as divinely ordained makes it even more repugnant. One Hadith in Bukhari has Muhammad telling Aisha he was shown her image on silk in a dream twice, with a voice declaring, \"This is your wife,\" which he interpreted as a sign from Allah. If true, this implicates the Islamic God himself in sanctioning the marriage of a grown man (in his early 50s) to a nine-year-old child."

It is a deeply disturbing event documented in Islam's core texts, showcasing actions by its founder that are ethically indefensible by modern standards. The frantic efforts by modern apologists to deny, obfuscate, or excuse it reveal their own awareness of its monstrosity. It stands as a stark indictment of the moral compass of the Prophet and the ethical foundations of the religion he founded."
