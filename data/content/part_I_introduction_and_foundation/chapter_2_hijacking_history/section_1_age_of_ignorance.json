They call it Jahiliyyah – usually translated as the \"Age of Ignorance.\" It's the picture of pre-Islamic Arabia as a barbaric wasteland, plunged in darkness, superstition, and moral depravity. Think rampant polytheism, tribal warfare, rampant injustice, and the infamous burying alive of unwanted baby girls. It's a convenient narrative, isn't it? It perfectly sets the stage for a heroic prophet to ride in, banish the darkness, and bring the supposed light of divine revelation."

            "text": "This picture of Jahiliyyah is absolutely central to Islamic self-perception. It's the essential \"before\" picture that makes the \"after\" – the arrival of Islam – seem so revolutionary, so necessary, so good. Muhammad wasn't just bringing a new religion; he was supposedly rescuing Arabia from itself, civilizing the savages, ending the ignorance. The Quran itself mentions \"Jahiliyyah\" four times, always with disapproval, contrasting it with the knowledge and guidance Islam brought. Hadiths reinforce it, with companions supposedly reminiscing about their unpleasant, ignorant past lives before the Prophet enlightened them."

            "text": "It's a powerful story. A foundational myth. And like many foundational myths, it's largely propaganda, a calculated rewriting of history designed to validate the new regime by demonizing the old one. Contemporary scholarship, looking beyond the self-serving Islamic sources, reveals a far more complex and nuanced picture of pre-Islamic Arabia. The idea of a monolithic \"Age of Ignorance\" simply doesn't hold up to scrutiny. It was a label slapped on retroactively, a polemical tool to erase the vibrant, diverse reality that existed before Muhammad and to justify the often brutal methods used to impose his new order. Before we look at what Muhammad did, we need to understand the world he actually entered – not the caricature presented in Islamic tradition."
