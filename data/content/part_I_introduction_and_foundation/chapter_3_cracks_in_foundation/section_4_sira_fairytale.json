            "text": "Finally, we come to the Sira literature – the biographies of Muhammad, most famously Ibn Ishaq's work (as edited by Ibn Hisham) and accounts by al-Waqidi and al-Tabari. These narratives form the basis for almost everything Muslims (and non-Muslims) think they know about Muhammad's life story, his personality, his campaigns, and the context of Quranic revelations. Surely, these must be historically reliable?"

            "type": "paragraph",
            "text": "Think again. Just like the Hadith, these biographical accounts suffer from a significant chronological gap. Ibn Ishaq, the earliest major biographer whose work substantially survives, died around 767 CE – nearly 140 years after Muhammad. Al-Waqidi died in 823 CE, and al-Tabari, whose massive history is a key source, died in 923 CE, almost three centuries after the Prophet! These are not contemporary accounts. They were compiled long after the events, based on collecting and selecting from the same pool of oral traditions, legends, and earlier fragmentary reports that fed into the Hadith collections."

            "text": "As such, they suffer from many of the same reliability issues. They are not objective, critical histories in the modern sense. They are primarily hagiographies – pious accounts written by believers, for believers, with the clear intention of glorifying the Prophet and validating the Islamic narrative. This doesn't mean they contain no historical information, but it means everything within them must be viewed with extreme skepticism."

            "type": "paragraph",
            "text": "Consider the purpose: These biographies were written during periods when the Islamic empire was consolidating its identity and legitimacy. Narratives about the Prophet's life served crucial functions – providing legal precedents, explaining Quranic verses (through asbab al-nuzul, occasions of revelation, which are themselves often historically dubious), establishing Muhammad's impeccable character (despite actions that might seem questionable), and demonstrating divine support for his mission through accounts of miracles or timely victories. There was immense pressure, conscious or unconscious, to shape the narrative in ways that served theological and political ends."

        {
            "type": "paragraph",
            "text": "Revisionist historians rightly point out that these Sira accounts often contain legendary elements, miraculous stories, and inconsistencies that betray their late composition and hagiographical purpose. The level of detail provided for events centuries earlier, the perfectly recalled dialogues, the attribution of prophetic foreknowledge – these are hallmarks of constructed narrative, not verbatim historical reporting."
        },
        {
            "type": "paragraph",
            "text": "So, when we read about Muhammad's specific actions, his motivations, the context of his revelations, or the details of his relationships and campaigns in these biographies, we are not reading objective history. We are reading a religiously and politically mediated interpretation of the past, crafted long after the fact by authors deeply invested in a particular outcome. While they are invaluable for understanding how later Muslims viewed their Prophet and history, they cannot be trusted as straightforward, factual accounts of 7th-century events. Relying on the Sira for uncritical historical detail is like writing a biography of Jesus based solely on medieval miracle stories or the Gospels read literally, ignoring decades of critical biblical scholarship. It mistakes faith narrative for historical fact."
