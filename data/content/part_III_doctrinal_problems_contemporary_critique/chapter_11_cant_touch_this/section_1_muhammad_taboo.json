            "text": "There's an invisible electric fence surrounding the entire discussion of Islam, more potent and dangerous than any other. It's the Muhammad Taboo. You can tiptoe around the edges, maybe critique some interpretations of Sharia, question certain Hadith, but dare to aim your critical lens directly at the founder himself? Prepare for shockwaves. Accusations. Threats. And sometimes, far worse. Muhammad isn't just respected in Islam; he's practically deified, wrapped in layers of theological immunity that demand he remain beyond reproach, beyond question, beyond even objective historical examination."

            "text": "Where does this come from? It's deeply embedded in the religion's core programming. Islamic theology developed the concept of 'Ismat al-Anbiyā' – the infallibility or sinlessness of prophets, especially Muhammad as the final and greatest prophet. If he's infallible, then criticizing his actions becomes tantamount to criticizing God's wisdom or plan. His Sunnah (his way, his example) is considered the second source of legislation after the Quran itself, making his life not just history, but divine precedent."

            "text": "Combine this with the harsh Islamic laws against blasphemy (sabb). As we saw, insulting Allah is bad enough, but insulting the Prophet Muhammad is often treated as the ultimate transgression, frequently carrying a mandatory death sentence in traditional jurisprudence, with little or no chance for repentance being accepted. This isn't just about rude language; historically, \"insult\" could encompass almost anything perceived as disrespectful, challenging his authority, or questioning his character."

            "text": "The result is a figure insulated from criticism by layers of sacredness and the explicit threat of lethal consequence. This isn't just about asking believers to be polite, like avoiding offensive cartoons (though that's part of it). It extends to any serious historical or ethical critique. Pointing out his documented marriage to a child, his orders for assassinations, his convenient revelations, his violent military campaigns – all meticulously documented in their own sources – is inevitably framed not as legitimate analysis, but as a malicious attack on the sacred, an \"insult\" to the Prophet, and therefore blasphemy."

            "text": "This manufactured taboo, this insistence that one man from 7th-century Arabia must remain untouchable, is the single greatest barrier to any honest conversation about Islam today. It forces scholars into self-censorship, journalists into euphemisms, and politicians into cowardly appeasement. It allows apologists to shut down any difficult discussion by simply crying \"You insulted the Prophet!\" It's time to smash this idol. Muhammad was a man, a historical figure – a vastly influential and often deeply problematic one. He deserves no special exemption from scrutiny."
