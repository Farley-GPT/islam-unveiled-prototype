            "text": "At the very heart of Islam lies Muhammad's claim to be a prophet receiving direct revelations from Allah via the Angel Gabriel. This assertion of supernatural communication is the ultimate source of his authority and the Quran's alleged divinity. Believers accept these experiences as sacred, transcendent events. But what happens if we strip away the reverence and examine the descriptions of these \"revelations\" through a modern, secular lens, considering known medical and psychological phenomena? The picture becomes far less divine and far more troubling."

            "text": "Islamic sources themselves, particularly Hadith, provide surprisingly detailed accounts of the physical and mental state Muhammad experienced during these episodes. Far from serene moments of enlightenment, they often sound like violent seizures or intense physiological distress. We read reports of him trembling severely, convulsing, sweating profusely even on cold days, his face changing color, falling to the ground, hearing ringing sounds like bells, experiencing difficulty breathing, his teeth chattering, sometimes even fainting or losing consciousness."

            "text": "For centuries, non-Muslim observers, starting with Byzantine historians like Theophanes as early as the 8th century, have pointed to these symptoms and suggested a medical explanation: epilepsy. Specifically, some modern commentators and even physicians have noted parallels with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE), a condition known to sometimes produce ecstatic feelings, auditory or visual hallucinations, and altered states of consciousness, often accompanied by physical seizure activity. While definitive retrospective diagnosis is impossible and highly controversial, the similarity of the reported symptoms to known neurological conditions cannot be easily dismissed."

            "text": "Other, more fringe, neurological theories have been floated – Michael Persinger's controversial \"God Helmet\" experiments suggesting magnetic fields could induce religious-like experiences by stimulating the temporal lobes, or links to \"Geschwind syndrome\" (temporal lobe personality) characterized by traits like hypergraphia and hyperreligiosity. While these alternative theories lack robust proof, they add to the spectrum of potential naturalistic explanations for experiences Muhammad's followers interpreted as divine."

            "text": "Of course, apologists vehemently reject these medical interpretations, often citing faulty translations or arguing the symptoms were simply the physical toll of receiving divine power. But the descriptions remain stubbornly consistent across multiple sources. Even if epilepsy or another specific condition cannot be proven, the sheer physicality and distress reported – the convulsions, the sweating, the fainting – fundamentally challenge the image of a calm prophet receiving clear messages from a benevolent God. It opens the door to disturbing possibilities: Were these experiences genuine neurological events misinterpreted as divine? Were they perhaps psychological episodes brought on by intense stress? Or, more cynically, could elements have been exaggerated or even feigned to enhance his authority and convince followers of his unique connection to the divine? We cannot know for sure, but the accounts themselves provide ample reason to question the supernatural origin story and consider more earthly, and potentially more pathological, explanations. The foundation of the prophecy looks less like divine inspiration and more like a medical mystery, or perhaps, a calculated performance."
