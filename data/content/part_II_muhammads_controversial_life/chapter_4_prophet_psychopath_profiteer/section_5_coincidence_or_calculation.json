            "text": "We see reported physical experiences during \"revelation\" that look remarkably like known neurological or psychological conditions, casting doubt on a purely supernatural source. We see a series of \"divine\" messages that arrive with uncanny timing to resolve Muhammad's personal dilemmas, grant him special privileges denied to his followers, justify controversial actions, or bolster his authority precisely when needed. We see a strategically brilliant marriage to a wealthy, older, influential widow that provides the essential financial independence and social standing required to even begin his public mission. We see a complex mix of early followers, ranging from wealthy merchants who might benefit from disrupting the old order, to enslaved individuals offered freedom and dignity."

            "text": "But calculation offers a much simpler, more coherent explanation. A man – perhaps charismatic, possibly suffering from misunderstood medical episodes he interprets (or presents) as divine, undoubtedly ambitious – leverages a strategic marriage. He crafts a message drawing on existing monotheistic ideas familiar in Arabia. When his personal desires clash with social norms or his own rules, he produces convenient \"revelations\" to justify them. When political opposition arises, the \"revelations\" provide justifications for separating from or condemning opponents. When followers are needed, the message appeals both to elite strategic interests and the desires of the marginalized for a better life."

            "text": "One instance of a convenient revelation might be dismissed. Two might raise eyebrows. But the sheer pattern of divine intervention aligning so perfectly with Muhammad's personal benefit, political needs, and strategic advancement throughout his career points strongly towards a calculated human enterprise. The claim of prophecy becomes the ultimate, unfalsifiable justification for earthly ambition. Whether driven by genuine delusion, cynical manipulation, or a complex mix of both, the evidence suggests Muhammad's path was paved less by divine intervention and more by shrewd opportunism and the masterful use of claimed heavenly authority to achieve very worldly goals."
