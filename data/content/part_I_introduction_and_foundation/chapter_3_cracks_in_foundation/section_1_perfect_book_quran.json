Muslims are taught it's the perfect, literal, unadulterated word of Allah, dictated verbatim to Muhammad through the Angel Gabriel, free from error, free from contradiction, unchanged and unchangeable for all time. It's a claim of breathtaking confidence. They even point to verse 4:82 as internal proof:"

Because when you actually read the Quran critically, without the filters of faith or the contortions of apologetics, the discrepancies aren't just there; they leap off the page. The claim of perfection dissolves under even basic scrutiny."

            "text": "Take the simple act of creation. Did Allah create the heavens or the Earth first? Surah 2:29 and 41:9-12 clearly state the Earth came first, then the seven heavens were formed. But flip over to Surah 79:27-30, and it's the opposite: heaven was built first, then the Earth was spread out \"after that.\" It can't be both. How long did creation take? Most verses say six days (7:54, 10:3, etc.). But Surah 41:9-12, if you add up the days mentioned for Earth, mountains/sustenance, and heavens, clearly describes an eight-day process. Sloppy accounting for an omniscient deity?"

            "text": "What about Allah's own words? Are they immutable, fixed forever? Verses like 6:115 (\"There is naught that can change His words\") and 10:64 (\"There is no changing the Words of Allah\") certainly claim so. Yet, the Quran itself introduces the doctrine of abrogation (naskh) in verses like 2:106 and 16:101, explicitly stating that Allah does substitute revelations, bringing \"one better or the like thereof.\" Apologists will call this divine refinement. A skeptic calls it Allah changing his mind, needing edits, contradicting his own claims of immutability – clear evidence of human tinkering with the text over time to resolve earlier inconsistencies or adapt to new situations."

            "text": "Who gets into paradise? The Quran can't seem to decide. Verses like 2:62 and 5:69 promise salvation to all righteous monotheists – Jews, Christians, Sabians – who believe in God and do good deeds. Sounds inclusive, right? But then Surah 3:85 slams that door shut: \"If anyone desires a religion other than Islam (submission to Allah), never will it be accepted of him.\" So which is it? Universal salvation for monotheists or exclusive salvation for Muslims? The text contradicts itself fundamentally on one of the most important theological questions."

            "type": "paragraph",
            "text": "These aren't minor quibbles over wording. They are substantive, internal contradictions on cosmology, theology, and soteriology. Pondering the Quran, as it suggests, reveals exactly what 4:82 claims you won't find if it were from God: discrepancy. And plenty of it. This is not the signature of a perfect divine author; it's the hallmark of a messy, evolving text compiled by human hands over time."
