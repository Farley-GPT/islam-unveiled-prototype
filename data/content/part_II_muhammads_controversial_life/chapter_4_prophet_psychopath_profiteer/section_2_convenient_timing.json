            "text": "Beyond the questionable nature of the revelatory experience itself, the content and timing of Muhammad's supposed divine messages raise enormous red flags. Time and time again, just when Muhammad faced a personal dilemma, a political challenge, or a desire that clashed with existing rules or social norms, a \"revelation\" would conveniently descend from heaven via Gabriel to provide the perfect justification, solution, or exemption – specifically for him. Coincidence? Or calculation? The pattern is too consistent, too self-serving, to ignore."

            "text": "Perhaps the most blatant example, one we'll dissect in detail later, is the Zaynab bint Jahsh affair. Muhammad desires the wife of his adopted son, Zayd. Social taboo and his own initial advice prevent him from acting. Lo and behold, after Zayd divorces her, down comes Quran 33:37, where Allah himself not only sanctions but commands Muhammad to marry Zaynab, explicitly stating it's to break the taboo regarding adopted sons' ex-wives, while also mentioning Muhammad was concealing his desire and fearing public opinion more than Allah. It's breathtakingly convenient – a divine intervention custom-tailored to fulfill a personal desire and simultaneously grant him unique legislative authority."

Unlimited wives, special categories of eligible women (including captives), even the right to accept women who offer themselves freely – all divine perks granted solely to Muhammad. Apologists scramble to justify this with talk of political alliances or prophetic burdens, but the naked special pleading, enshrined in supposed divine scripture, is undeniable."

            "text": "Allah even apparently got involved in Muhammad's domestic squabbles. Surah At-Tahrim (66:1-5) directly addresses an incident where Muhammad prohibited something lawful (likely relations with a wife or concubine, or consuming honey, depending on the interpretation) just to please some of his wives. Allah gently chastises him (\"O Prophet! Why do you prohibit... what Allah has made lawful to you, seeking to please your wives?\") before turning with threats towards the wives involved, warning Muhammad might divorce them all and Allah would give him \"better\" wives in their place. Imagine having a direct line to God to manage your household disputes and put your wives in their place!"

            "type": "paragraph",
            "text": "Add to this the Hadith where Muhammad claims unique privileges denied to previous prophets – the right to intercede for his followers on Judgment Day, permission to take war spoils (which earlier prophets supposedly couldn't). The pattern emerges: whenever a rule needed bending, a desire needed fulfilling, a privilege needed granting, or authority needed bolstering for Muhammad himself, a timely \"revelation\" or divine insight was readily available. This relentless alignment between divine command and personal/political convenience stretches credulity to the breaking point. It paints a picture not of a humble messenger relaying God's impartial word, but of a shrewd operator using the claim of divine revelation as an infinitely flexible tool for personal gain and power consolidation."
