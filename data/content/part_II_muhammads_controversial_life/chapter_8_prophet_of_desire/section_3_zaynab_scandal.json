            "text": "If the Aisha marriage reveals a disturbing disregard for childhood innocence, the affair surrounding Zaynab bint Jahsh exposes a stunning pattern of self-serving \"revelation\" used to navigate personal desire and social taboo. This wasn't just about Muhammad getting special privileges; it was about Allah himself seemingly intervening to facilitate Muhammad's controversial union with his own adopted son's ex-wife, right after Muhammad reportedly developed an attraction to her. The narrative, embedded directly within the Quran, is perhaps the single most compelling piece of evidence for the claim that Muhammad's revelations often served his own earthly interests."

            "text": "Here's the story, pieced together from traditional sources: Zaynab was Muhammad's first cousin, a woman of high social standing. Muhammad himself arranged her marriage to Zayd ibn Harithah, his freed slave whom he had adopted as a son (so much so that Zayd was known as \"Zayd bin Muhammad\"). This marriage itself was controversial, bridging a significant class divide, and reports suggest it was unhappy, possibly due to Zaynab's awareness of her superior lineage."

            "text": "The pivotal moment comes when Muhammad visits Zayd's house. Zayd isn't home, but Zaynab answers. Accounts like al-Tabari's describe her being minimally dressed. Muhammad is reportedly struck by her beauty, turns away muttering praises to Allah (\"Glory be to God the Almighty! Glory be to God, who causes hearts to turn!\"), and leaves. When Zayd learns of this, sensing Muhammad's admiration (or perhaps feeling pressured), he offers to divorce Zaynab for the Prophet. According to the sources, Muhammad initially tells Zayd: \"Keep your wife to yourself and fear Allah,\" seemingly resisting the temptation."

            "text": "But the marriage continued to falter, and eventually Zayd did divorce Zaynab. Now, pre-Islamic Arab custom treated adopted sons like biological sons, meaning marrying the former wife of one's adopted son was considered taboo, akin to incest. Did Muhammad respect this taboo? Did he abide by his own advice to Zayd?"

So when Zayd had no longer any need for her, We married her to you that there might not be for the believers any difficulty concerning the wives of their adopted sons, when they no longer have need of them. And ever is the command of Allah accomplished.\""

            "text": "For critics, the verse itself lays bare the manipulation. Allah explicitly acknowledges Muhammad was concealing something – his desire for Zaynab, perhaps, or maybe Allah's supposed plan for them to marry – driven by a fear of public opinion that outweighed his fear of Allah Himself. Then, immediately after Zayd conveniently finalizes the divorce, the verse declares that Allah personally performed the marriage ceremony (\"We married her to you\"). The stated justification becomes a piece of divine legislation – abolishing the pre-Islamic taboo against marrying an adopted son's ex-wife for the benefit of all believers. How incredibly neat! The verse simultaneously confirms Muhammad's hidden internal conflict rooted in social fear, absolves him by having Allah take direct action, and provides a noble, community-wide legislative reason for a union that began with the Prophet's problematic admiration for his adopted son's wife. It's difficult for a skeptic to see this as anything other than the ultimate \"convenient revelation,\" a divine command perfectly tailored to fulfill a personal desire and override social constraints, with the law-making aspect serving as a convenient, almost secondary, justification. It's the smoking gun suggesting revelations were tools Muhammad wielded for personal and political ends, written directly into the fabric of his \"holy\" book."
