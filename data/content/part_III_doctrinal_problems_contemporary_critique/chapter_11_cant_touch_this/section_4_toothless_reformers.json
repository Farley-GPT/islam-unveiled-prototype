While such individuals and movements certainly exist, their efforts have consistently failed to gain widespread traction or fundamentally alter the problematic core of the religion. Why? Because the vast majority of mainstream \"reformers\" suffer from a fatal flaw: they dare not touch the third rail. They refuse to engage in any meaningful, critical examination of Muhammad himself."

                "**Contextualization:** Arguing endlessly that problematic verses commanding violence or discriminatory practices were specific only to Muhammad's 7th-century situation and hold no relevance today, conveniently ignoring the question of why a supposedly universal divine message would contain such time-bound and ethically dubious commands.",
                "**Selective Emphasis:** Highlighting the earlier, more spiritual and seemingly peaceful Meccan verses while strategically downplaying or explaining away the far more numerous, explicit, and often brutal legislative and military commands found in the later Medinan surahs – effectively ignoring the traditional Islamic doctrine of abrogation which often holds that the later verses cancel out the earlier ones.",
                "**Reinterpreting Jihad:** Insisting it primarily signifies a noble, internal spiritual struggle, despite the overwhelming weight of textual and historical evidence in Islam's foundational sources where jihad overwhelmingly refers to physical warfare against unbelievers.",
                "**Blaming Misinterpretation:** Claiming that extremists like ISIS or oppressive regimes like the Taliban are simply twisting and distorting the inherently peaceful and just \"true Islam,\" refusing to acknowledge that these groups often justify their actions with disturbingly literal readings of the Quran and Hadith.",
                "**Focusing on Maqasid:** Appealing to the supposed higher objectives of Sharia like justice and mercy, arguing these should guide interpretation over the literal, often harsh, commands - a laudable goal, perhaps, but one that lacks widespread traditional authority and effectively requires ignoring vast swathes of established Islamic law."

How can you truly reform a system when its founder married a child? How can you promote peace when the founder ordered assassinations and justified offensive warfare through divine revelation? How can you advocate for equality when the founder received exclusive divine privileges and the core texts codify discrimination?"

            "text": "The traditional Islamic concept of 'Ismah – prophetic infallibility – creates an almost insurmountable barrier. If Muhammad is deemed sinless and his Sunnah (example) is considered a primary source of guidance, then critically evaluating his documented actions becomes theologically impossible for most believers. It requires either denying the veracity of uncomfortable accounts in their own revered sources (Bukhari, Muslim, Ibn Ishaq) or engaging in elaborate, often dishonest, apologetic gymnastics to explain them away."

            "text": "This refusal to confront the problematic aspects of the founder means that \"moderate reform\" often remains superficial, unable to address the textual and historical roots of intolerance, violence, and oppression that extremists draw upon. They are attempting to build a modern house on medieval foundations without daring to inspect the rot in the basement. Until Muslim reformers – and their Western supporters – find the courage to apply critical historical and ethical scrutiny to Muhammad himself, discarding the myth of infallibility, genuine, deep-rooted reform that reconciles Islam with universal human rights and intellectual freedom will likely remain an elusive, perhaps impossible, dream. The \"moderate\" approach fails because it lacks the courage to address the source."
