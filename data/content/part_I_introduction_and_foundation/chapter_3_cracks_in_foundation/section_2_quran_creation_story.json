            "text": "The traditional story they feed you about the Quran's compilation is neat and tidy. Muhammad received the revelations over 23 years, his companions memorized them perfectly, some fragments were written down, and shortly after his death, Caliphs Abu Bakr and then Uthman meticulously gathered everything into one official, error-free volume, burning all variants to ensure purity. It's a narrative designed to inspire confidence in the text's absolute integrity from the very beginning."

            "text": "But dig just a little deeper, apply standard historical-critical methods – the same kinds used to study the Bible or any other ancient text – and that comforting story starts to look very shaky. A growing school of thought among critical historians, often labeled \"revisionist,\" questions this entire timeline and process. Scholars like John Wansbrough, Patricia Crone, Michael Cook, and Stephen Shoemaker, looking at the available evidence (and lack thereof), suggest the Quran wasn't fully formed and canonized until much later, perhaps as late as the 8th or even 9th century, well into the Abbasid period, long after Muhammad."

            "text": "What's the evidence for such a radical rethinking? Part of it is the absence of clear external proof. Where are the unambiguous references to the complete Quran as we know it in non-Islamic sources from the 7th century, the supposed time of its compilation? Early Christian accounts describing the Arab conquerors sometimes mention them having scriptures or revering the Torah, but specific references to the standardized Quran are scarce until later."

            "text": "More compelling is the physical evidence. The traditional narrative insists Uthman created the definitive text around 650 CE and destroyed all variations. Yet, discoveries like the Sanaa Palimpsest in Yemen throw a massive wrench in those claims. Found in 1972, this is one of the oldest Quranic manuscripts ever discovered, radiocarbon dated to before 671 CE, potentially even earlier. And crucially, it's a palimpsest – meaning it was scraped clean and written over. The upper text largely conforms to the standard Uthmanic Quran. But sophisticated imaging revealed the lower text, the original one that was erased. And that lower text shows significant variations from the standard version – different spellings, different words, even a different order of surahs (chapters) corresponding to no known Quranic arrangement! This is physical, tangible proof that variant Quranic traditions existed after Uthman's supposed standardization, and that the text was still evolving. German scholar Gerd Puin, who studied it, concluded it pointed to \"an evolving text as opposed to a fixed one.\""

            "text": "Wansbrough's textual analysis noted how different versions of the same story (like the Prophet Shu'ayb) appear in separate chapters, suggesting these were originally independent traditions later stitched together into the canonical text, rather than flowing from a single authorial vision."
        },
        {
            "type": "paragraph",
            "text": "So, instead of a perfect book delivered complete and standardized in the mid-7th century, the historical and manuscript evidence suggests a much messier, longer process. A period where different textual traditions circulated, where the text evolved, and where the final, standardized version might not have emerged until centuries after Muhammad, solidifying only as the Islamic empire itself consolidated its identity and power. The claim of an untouched, perfectly preserved text from day one looks less like historical fact and more like a later assertion of orthodoxy designed to cement authority."
